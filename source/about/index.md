# Contributing

## Contribute to the Meetup

We always welcome outside speakers. Talks generally range from 10-30 minutes. You can speak about anything related to Python, including:

- **An application or script you've written**: This can be as fundamental as it gets. If you've written a script and it's solved a problem for you, we'd love to hear about it. It doesn't have to be complicated or fancy, as we welcome all newcomers and experienced dev alike to share experiences.
- **Frameworks you've used**: Have you used a framework that you thought was cool or interesting? We welcome you to speak about frameworks and Python tools that you think others might want to learn about.
- **Modules you've used**: There are a ton of Python modules out there. We've love to hear about modules you've used in your work, no matter how small.

We're open to any ideas! Message us on <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Redmond-Python-User-Group/">Meetup.com</a> if you have an idea for talk you'd like to give.
