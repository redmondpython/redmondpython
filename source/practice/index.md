## Exercises and tutorials in Python 2

These exercises and tutorials are in Python 2, but since they're all browser-based you should be able to follow along regardless of what version of Python you use locally. 

- [**Codecademy**](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-beginner-en-kSQwt/0/1): This is part of Codecademy's Intro to Python class. Again, you can create an account to track your progress and access additional lessons.

Remember the two main differences in Python 2 and 3:

```
# Printing in Python 2
print "Hello World"
# Printing in Python 3
print("Hello World")

# Division in Python 2
5/2   # result is 2
5/2.0 # result is 2.5
# Division in Python 3
5/2   # result is 2.5
5//2  # result is 2
```
