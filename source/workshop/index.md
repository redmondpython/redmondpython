Welcome to the Redmond Python Workshop!

## What is a workshop?

The Redmond Python Workshop is a workshop given by the organization to walk beginners through the setup and basics of Python in a 6-hour course. We go over all of the basic material, allowing students to ask questions, and we have TAs there to help with any setup issues you encounter. It's one of the easiest ways to get started with Python. Join the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Redmond-Python-User-Group/">Meetup</a> and keep your eye out for upcoming Workshops.
