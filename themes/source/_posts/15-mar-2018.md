- [Nick](https://www.github.com/mkpt) did a lightning talk about the Flask Framework. We built an API live at the meetup. [The code and slides can be found here](https://github.com/mkpt/basic-flask-api).
- Afterwards [Rakesh](https://www.github.com/rakeshsinghranchi) deployed it to Microsoft Azure. [The code can be found here](https://github.com/rakeshsinghranchi/basic-flask-api).
